<h1>All time best movies according to Akaka Jerry</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<h3>24 Seasons</h3>

<p>24 stands out as my best movie because of the characterization of the move,<br />
there are a few characters that stood out like the lead actor Jack Bauer, he is <br />
such a prolific actor, very sensitive, full of energy, compasioneate, determined,<br />
always believing, he is heroic, sacrificial and most expecially very loyal to his<br />
friends.<p>

<P>The Tech and inteligeence gattring part of CTU, featuring some very sharp brians<br /> 
like Chloe makes it even more interesting to watch. I would watch 24 seasons for<br />
a billion times an would literally still long fo the movie. if you are thinking of a<br />
movie to make history in your memory, you definitely want to see 24 seasons</P>
